Websocket Game

This is a simple game that uses Websocket to allow users to control the game with their phone. The game can be played on a computer screen or on a projector, while the phone can be used as a wireless controller.

Installation:
1. To get started with the game, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.  Go to the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the latest version of Node.js for your operating system.

2. Follow the installation instructions provided by the Node.js installer to install Node.js on your machine.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to check if Node.js and npm are installed:
    "node -v"
    "npm -v"
        
If you see the version numbers of Node.js and npm in the output, it means that they are installed and you can move on to the next step.
